# Changelog

All notable changes to the Immich-Go GUI project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - Unreleased

### Changed
- **Flag system simplification:** removed `emission` field from `flags.toml`; each flag is either `mode = "simple"` (emit when value ≠ default) or `mode = "advanced"` (emit when row enabled)
- Moved `client-timeout`, `concurrent-tasks`, `device-uuid`, `on-errors`, and `pause-immich-jobs` from Config tab to per-tab Advanced Flags rows
- `on-errors` advanced row is now free text: `stop`, `continue`, or a numeric max-error count
- Eliminated `mode = "both"`; Picasa album flags are simple-mode only
- `command_builder` uses a generic simple-flag loop plus positional-owned flag handler (no dedup, no config-tab emission path)

### Removed
- Config tab widgets: Client Timeout, Concurrent Tasks, Device UUID, On Errors, Pause Jobs
- `AppConfig` persisted fields for the above (legacy keys ignored on load)
- `ON_ERRORS_CUSTOM_LABEL` / tolerance spinbox UI

### Added
- `on-errors` validation in `validate_advanced_state()`
- Per-value `warn_values` on `manage-burst` / `manage-raw-jpeg` in `flags.toml`

### Note
- Upgrading from older configs: global `on_errors` / `pause_immich_jobs` preferences are **not** auto-migrated to per-tab advanced rows. Re-enable them on each tab if needed.

---

## [1.3.0] - Unreleased

### Changed
- Replaced `config_emitted` boolean with four-value `emission` field in `flags.toml` (`always`, `config`, `advanced`, `config+advanced`)
- Unified `config+advanced` resolution via `_resolve_config_advanced()` for `log-level`, `on-errors`, and `pause-jobs`
- Simple vs advanced mode distinguished by `advanced_state=None` vs `dict`
- Config-tab preferences now flow through in Simple mode

### Added
- `CommandPlan.emission_log` with per-flag source tracking
- Flag Sources panel in run confirmation dialog
- `tests/test_emission_model.py` integration tests

### Fixed
- `REPEAT_FLAGS` no longer includes boolean `takeout-tag` / `people-tag`
- Archive registry key aligned: `target-folder` → `write-to`
- Removed dead `upload-icloud` album-flag emission; added `upload-folder` `--into-album` emission
- Pause-jobs admin-key safety pass when no flag otherwise emitted

---

## [1.2.0] - Unreleased

### Changed
- Unified CLI flag registry: `core/flags.toml` is now the single source of truth (via `flag_registry.py`); `cli_schema` / `advanced_flags` are delegation shims
- About dialog reads the package version dynamically from metadata
- Stylesheet extracted to `assets/theme.qss`
- `check_binary_help` covers all 11 tabs

### Fixed
- Picasa simple-mode album flags no longer stripped (`mode=both`)
- Duplicate config/advanced flag emission guarded (`config_emitted` + FlagEmitter dedup)
- `upload-folder` `log-level` correctly marked `config_emitted`

### Added
- Keyring availability probe and Config-tab secret storage status indicator
- Rotating GUI log at `{config_dir}/logs/immich-go-gui.log` (argv masked)
- Debounced silent connection test and coalesced status updates
- Close confirmation with Save / Discard / Cancel
- Periodic stale temp-dir cleanup timer

### Docs
- Developer guides updated for `flags.toml`; POSIX env inheritance and Python pin rationale documented

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/shitan198u/immich-go-gui/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.2) - 2026-07-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Windows Runtime)

* **command_builder**: auto-disable `--pause-immich-jobs` when no Admin API Key is configured — previously caused an immediate `403 Forbidden` that aborted every upload ([#64](https://github.com/shitan198u/immich-go-gui/issues/64))
* **terminal_launcher**: remove bat file self-deletion — the script deleting itself under `cmd /k` caused `The batch file cannot be found` to be printed after every run ([#68](https://github.com/shitan198u/immich-go-gui/issues/68))
* **terminal_launcher**: revert `shell=True` which caused the CMD window to be invisible — the list-form `Popen` with `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` correctly shows the terminal window
* **process_tracker**: lock now clears immediately when the CMD window is closed — previously the orphan heartbeat subprocess kept the lock "active" indefinitely, blocking re-uploads ([#69](https://github.com/shitan198u/immich-go-gui/issues/69))
* **binary_manager**: resolve binary path via `Path.resolve()` before `subprocess.run` to fix `Error running binary` in Binary Management on Windows ([#66](https://github.com/shitan198u/immich-go-gui/issues/66))

### 🧹 Maintenance

* Pin Python to 3.13 in CI for Nuitka build compatibility
* Add `pyfakefs>=5.5.0` as dev dependency for Windows simulation tests

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### 🚀 Features & UI Completeness (11/11 CLI Sub-Commands)
- **5 New GUI Sub-Tabs**: Added full GUI coverage for all 11 `immich-go` CLI sub-commands:
  - `upload-icloud` (`upload from-icloud`): Support for iCloud photo library imports with `--memories` flag and HEIC/JPEG pair handling.
  - `upload-picasa` (`upload from-picasa`): Support for Picasa album exports and `--album-picasa` metadata detection.
  - `archive-gp` (`archive from-google-photos`): Serverless archive tab for Google Takeout photo libraries with takeout filters.
  - `archive-icloud` (`archive from-icloud`): Serverless archive tab for iCloud photo libraries with `--memories` support.
  - `archive-picasa` (`archive from-picasa`): Serverless archive tab for Picasa photo libraries with `--album-picasa` support.
- **Serverless Tab Isolation**: Explicitly classified `archive-folder`, `archive-gp`, `archive-icloud`, and `archive-picasa` as `SERVERLESS_TABS`, guaranteeing they never emit `--server`, `--api-key`, or `--client-timeout` flags.
- **Pre-Flight Server Connectivity Check**: Added fast pre-flight connection check (`/api/server/about`) before launching server-required commands, warning users if the Immich server is unreachable (`connection refused` / `timeout`).
- **Help Menu Links**: Added direct links to Immich-Go CLI (`simulot/immich-go`) and Immich-Go GUI (`shitan198u/immich-go-gui`) GitHub repositories alongside an interactive About dialog.

### 🛡️ Security & Secret Management
- **Environment Variable Secret Delivery**: Migrated sensitive API keys (`IMMICH_GO_UPLOAD_API_KEY`, `IMMICH_GO_UPLOAD_FROM_IMMICH_FROM_API_KEY`, etc.) away from CLI command arguments (`argv`) to process environment variables.
- **Zero Plaintext Disk Files**: Completely eliminated disk shell files (`env.sh`) in favor of direct process launching via Python `subprocess.Popen`.
- **OS Keyring Integration**: Supported OS Keyring (Keychain, KWallet, Credential Manager) for secure API key storage.
- **Redacted Previews & Logs**: Sanitized command confirmation dialogs and log files to prevent credential leakage.
- **SSL Bypass Warning Banners**: Displayed clear inline safety warnings when `--skip-verify-ssl` is activated.

### 🔧 Release & Runtime Safety
- **Binary Manager**: Centralized release version fetching, binary downloads, SHA256 checksum verification, and graceful cancellation cleanup.
- **Safe Working Directory Isolation**: POSIX launchers execute inside isolated temporary directories with safe `$HOME` fallback directory changes, avoiding working directory deletion crashes.
- **Windows Terminal Heartbeat**: Hardened Windows external terminal execution using temporary `.bat` launcher scripts and background heartbeat loops (`.heartbeat`) for clean lock lifecycle tracking.
- **Validation Engine**: Standardized date range validation (`YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD` and single dates) with full calendar semantic checks.

### 📦 Multi-Platform Packaging & CI
- **Automated Standalone Builds**: Compiled standalone distributions for Windows (Installer & Portable), macOS (DMG), and Linux (AppImage, DEB, RPM, Portable Tarball).
- **Version & Architecture Tagging**: Standardized output package names to include version and architecture (e.g., `Immich-Go-GUI-1.1.0-Windows-x86_64-Setup.exe`, `Immich-Go-GUI-1.1.0-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`).

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure
- **Cross-Platform Test Suite**: Added `_norm_argv` path normalization helper ensuring 100% test suite pass rate (149/149 tests) across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Golden State Fixtures**: Added JSON fixture files and golden test cases for all 11 sub-commands.
