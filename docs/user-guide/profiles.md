# Profiles

Profiles let you maintain separate configurations for different Immich servers, environments, or use cases. Each profile has its own settings, form state, and API keys.

## Profile Layout

Profiles are stored under the config directory:

```text
~/.config/immich-go-gui/          (Linux example)
├── profiles.toml                 # Index: active profile, profile list
└── profiles/
    ├── default/
    │   ├── config.toml           # Settings and form state
    │   └── secrets.toml          # Plaintext secrets (fallback only)
    └── work/
        ├── config.toml
        └── secrets.toml
```

The **default** profile is created automatically on first run. It cannot be renamed or deleted.

## Managing Profiles

From the Config tab you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Switch profile** | Select a different active profile; the GUI reloads its settings |
| **Create** | New empty profile or copy from an existing one |
| **Duplicate** | Clone an existing profile including config and keyring secrets |
| **Rename** | Change profile name (not available for `default`) |
| **Delete** | Remove a profile and its files (not available for `default`) |

When you duplicate or create from an existing profile, API keys are copied in the OS keyring under the new profile name.

## Profile Naming Rules

Profile names must:

- Start with a letter or number
- Contain only letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, or underscores
- Be at most 64 characters
- Be unique (case-insensitive)

Invalid characters such as `/` or `\` are rejected.

## What Is Stored Per Profile

Each profile's `config.toml` includes:

- Server URL and SSL settings
- Theme and advanced mode preference
- **form_state** — Per-tab field values and advanced-row enablement (timeout, concurrent tasks, on-errors, etc. are per-tab, not global)

API keys are stored separately in the keyring (or `secrets.toml` as fallback), scoped by profile name.

## Migration from Legacy Config

If you upgraded from an older single-file layout, the GUI automatically migrates:

- `config.toml` to `profiles/default/config.toml`
- `secrets.toml` to `profiles/default/secrets.toml`

Original files are renamed with a `.pre-profile.bak` suffix.

## Environment Override

Set `IMMICH_GO_GUI_CONFIG` to point at a specific config file. The profile directory is derived from that file's parent path. See [Config Schema](../reference/config-schema.md).

## Tips

- Use **work** / **home** profiles when you manage multiple Immich instances.
- Duplicate a working profile before experimenting with advanced flags.
- Switching profiles reloads all tab fields — save any in-progress changes first if needed.
- Keep a **staging** profile pointed at a test Immich server for dry-runs of large Takeouts.
- Profile names are case-insensitive for uniqueness — `Home` and `home` collide.
